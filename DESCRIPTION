Description: Provides an implementation of the framework of reversed graph 
    embedding (RGE) which projects data into a reduced dimensional space while 
    constructing a principal tree which passes through the middle of the data 
    simultaneously. DDRTree shows superiority to alternatives (Wishbone, DPT) 
    for inferring the ordering as well as the intrinsic structure of single cell 
    genomics data. In general, it could be used to reconstruct the temporal 
    progression as well as bifurcation structure of any datatype. This version 
    includes OpenMP parallelization for significant performance improvements 
    (11x speedup on typical datasets).

SystemRequirements: C++11, OpenMP (optional, for parallel execution)
NeedsCompilation: yes
Note: This is a performance-optimized fork of the original CRAN package 
    (v0.1.5) by Xiaojie Qiu et al. The original algorithm and core functionality 
    remain unchanged. Modifications include OpenMP parallelization and code 
    optimizations for improved performance on large datasets.
