DDRTree 0.0.0 Series NEWS
================================================================================

Version 0.2.0 (2025-10-03) - Performance-Optimized Fork
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
  o Implemented OpenMP parallelization for 11x performance improvement
    - Parallelized soft assignment computation (primary bottleneck)
    - Achieved 11x speedup on real-world data (1000 genes Ã— 5536 cells)
    - Execution time reduced from 296.83s to 27.00s
    - Throughput increased from 19 to 205 cells/second
    - No memory overhead or numerical differences
  
  o Code optimizations for better performance and maintainability
    - Efficient matrix broadcasting using Eigen's replicate()
    - Pre-allocated matrices to reduce memory allocations
    - Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
  
  o Build system improvements
    - Added Makevars for automatic OpenMP compilation
    - Conditional compilation for backward compatibility
    - Thread count detection and reporting

DOCUMENTATION
  o Added comprehensive performance documentation
    - OPENMP_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md: Technical details and analysis
    - PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.txt: Quick reference guide
    - benchmark_real_data.R: Reproducible benchmark script

NOTES
  o This is a performance-optimized fork of CRAN v0.1.5
  o Original algorithm and core functionality unchanged
  o Maintains identical numerical results
  o Backward compatible - falls back to serial execution if OpenMP unavailable
  o Scales linearly with dataset size
  o Maintainer: Billsfriend <Billsfriend1999@outlook.com>
  o Original authors: Xiaojie Qiu, Cole Trapnell, Qi Mao, Li Wang

Version 0.1.5 (2017-04-14) - Original CRAN Release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGFIXES
  o Fixed an problem where DDRTree would return different results on
    repeated runs given the same inputs. The problem was actually in DDRTree in
    two places: kmeans and irlba. We now call irlba with deterministically
    initialized eigenvectors and kmeans with deterministically selected rows of
    the input.

Version 0.1.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGFIXES
  o Fixed a build error triggered by recent versions of GCC using the C++14
    standard
