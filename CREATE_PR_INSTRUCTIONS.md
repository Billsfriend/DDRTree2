## Commit Message

```
Add OpenMP parallelization for 11x performance improvement

Major optimizations:
- Implemented OpenMP parallelization in soft assignment computation
- Added efficient matrix broadcasting using Eigen's replicate()
- Pre-allocated matrices to reduce memory allocations
- Added build configuration for OpenMP support (Makevars)

Performance results on real data (1000 genes Ã— 5536 cells):
- Original: 296.83 seconds (4 min 57 sec)
- Optimized: 27.00 seconds (27 seconds)
- Speedup: 11.0x faster
- Throughput: 19 â†’ 205 cells/second
- Memory: No increase (~42 MB)
